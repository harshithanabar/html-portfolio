<h1>The Best Movies According to Harshit</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Spider-Man No Way Home</h3>
<p>
One of the most subtle things about the movie, and one of the reasons it's so great,
is that it actually retcons the earlier iterations of the Spider-Man movie franchise without actually retconning them. 
With the villains cured,they return to their timelines, but they actually create new ones 
</p>
<h3>The Social Network</h3>
<p>
One of my favorite movies ever made, The Social Network contains a brilliant script,
great casting and acting, a great score, and a great pace. It depicts college life in its highs and lows. 
There's a lot of drinking and some language.

<h3>The Hundred Foot Jounery</h3>
<p>
The Hundred-Foot Journey‚Äù is a film that demands that you take it seriously. 
With its feel-good themes of multicultural understanding, it is about Something Important. 
It even comes with the stamp of approval from titanic tastemakers Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg,
who both serve as producers
